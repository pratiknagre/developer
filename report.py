SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data stored in a relational database.
SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you describe what you want to accomplish, and the database management system figures out how to do it. SQL statements are written in a standardized syntax that can be used with a variety of relational database management systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and others.
SQL can be used for a wide range of tasks related to relational databases, such as creating tables, defining relationships between tables, inserting and updating data, and querying data using various conditions and filters. It is a powerful tool for managing large amounts of data and is widely used in businesses and organizations of all sizes.
Some of the most common SQL commands include SELECT (used for retrieving data), INSERT (used for adding new data to a table), UPDATE (used for modifying existing data in a table), and DELETE (used for removing data from a table).
